    The Robo-trio have found a desert and the ships sensors have registered ore
    in the region. The desert has a size of 10x10 cells and can be represented
    as a 2D array. They have <strong>four</strong> probes for finding ore. At each step you will
    need to return the coordinates of a cell (as [row, column]) for the probe. If the cell
    contains ore, then you can finish. Else the probe will give a distance to
    ore cell (It will be the Euclidean distance between cells' centers). The
    perception of probe is not good and it will give the result rounded to the
    closest integer (1.41 ≈ 1; 2.83 ≈ 3). At each step you get information of
    the previous probes as a list of list. Each list will be in the following
    format: [row, column, distance]. For the start of the mission you get only
    an empty list.
