    During their adventure, the Robo-trio came accross a desert, and the ships sensors have registered ore
    in the region. The desert has a size of 10x10 cells and can be represented
    as a 2D array. The ship has <strong>four</strong> probes which can be used to help us in finding the ore. 
    At each step you will need to return the coordinates of a cell (as [row, column]) for the probe to travel to. 
    If the cell contains ore, then you can finish; else the probe will give a distance to the location of the
    ore cell (It will be the Euclidean distance between cells' centers). The
    perception of probe is not very good and it will give you a result rounded to the
    closest integer (1.41 ≈ 1; 2.83 ≈ 3). At each step you receive information from
    the previous probes as a list of list. Each list will be in the following
    format: [row, column, distance]. At the beginning of the mission, you will only receive an empty list.
